Language Translator AI





📌 Project Overview

The Language Translator AI is a deep learning-based translation system designed to convert text from English to Hindi. It leverages state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models and Transformer architectures, to provide accurate and context-aware translations.

🚀 Features

English-to-Hindi Translation: Converts input text from English to Hindi with high accuracy.

Deep Learning-Based Model: Uses Seq2Seq and Transformer architectures.

Preprocessing Pipeline: Cleans and tokenizes text for better translation quality.

Evaluation Metrics: BLEU score and accuracy metrics to assess performance.

Scalable Implementation: Can be extended to support additional languages.

🔧 Installation

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/NivethaRajamani/Language_Translator-AI.git
cd Language_Translator-AI

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # For Linux/macOS
env\Scripts\activate      # For Windows

3. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

🏋️ Training the Model

To train the model on the dataset, run:

python train.py

This script preprocesses the data, trains the Seq2Seq or Transformer model, and saves the trained model.

📝 Running Inference

To translate English text into Hindi using the trained model, execute:

python inference.py --text "Hello, how are you?"

📊 Evaluation

To evaluate the model’s performance using BLEU score:

python evaluate.py

📌 Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow / PyTorch

Seq2Seq Model

Transformer Model

NLTK / SpaCy for text preprocessing

🔥 Future Enhancements

Add support for additional languages.

Improve model accuracy using larger datasets.

Deploy the model as a web or mobile application.
